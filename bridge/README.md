# Bridge (Creational)
It separates the abstraction from the implementation so that the two can vary independently.

## Wikipedia Description

Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies — abstraction and implementation — which can be developed independently of each other.


# Usage examples 

The Bridge pattern is especially useful when dealing with cross-platform apps, supporting multiple types of database servers or working with several API providers of a certain kind (for example, cloud platforms, social networks, etc.)
