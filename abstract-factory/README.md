# Abstract Factory (Creational)

It creates families or groups of common objects without specifying their concrete classes.


The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes

A Factory is simply an object that creates other objects.

# Problem

Imagine that youâ€™re creating a furniture shop simulator. Your code consists of classes that represent:

- A family of related products, say: Chair + Sofa + CoffeeTable.

- Several variants of this family. For example, products Chair + Sofa + CoffeeTable are available in these variants: Modern, Victorian, ArtDeco.
