# Adapter (Structural)
This pattern allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping their own interface around existing class

## Wikipedia Description
In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

## Using Adapter

One scenario where Adapters are commonly used is when new components need to be integrated and work together with existing components in the application.

Another scenario is refactoring in which parts of the program are rewritten with an improved interface, but the old code still expects the original interface.
