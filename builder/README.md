# Builder (Creational)
It constructs complex objects from simple objects.

## Wikipedia Description

The builder pattern is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming.


# Problem 

Imagine a complex object that requires laborious, step-by-step initialization of many fields and nested objects. Such initialization code is usually buried inside a monstrous constructor with lots of parameters. Or even worse: scattered all over the client code.
